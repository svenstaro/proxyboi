<!-- next-header -->

## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate
- Upgraded to actix-web 3
- Added `--respons-header` to add additional headers to the final response returned to the client
- Added `--upstream-header` to add additional headers to the request towards the proxied upstream service

## [0.4.5] - 2021-02-25
- Allow to specify connection timeout via --timeout [#80](https://github.com/svenstaro/proxyboi/pull/80) (thanks @holgzn)
- Modernize CI and publish workflows.

## [0.4.4] - 2020-11-09
- Automatic Docker tags per git tag
- Lockfile bumps

## [0.4.3] - 2020-02-06
- Increase sending/receiving body limit to 1G

## [0.4.2] - 2019-11-15
- Never send `transfer-encoding: chunked` when receiving a body.
  Wait for the body to complete and then just send a proper response with `content-length`.

## [0.4.1] - 2019-10-09
- Fix body forwarding behavior to always receive the whole body first.
  This might come back later to bite us with HTTP/2, HTTP/3 or websockets but
  for now gets rid of a problem where `awc` would send both `Content-Length`
  and `Transfer-Encoding` at the same time which is forbidden by
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2

## [0.4.0] - 2019-10-01
- Add option (`-k`/`--insecure`) to allow connecting to insecure TLS upstreams
- Allow logging to work if not run with an allocated terminal

## [0.3.0] - 2019-09-25
- Add verbose logging option (#2)

## [0.2.0] - 2019-09-12
- First proper release
